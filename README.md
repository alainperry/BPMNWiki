# BPMNWiki
BPMNWiki is a BPMN extension for mediawiki based on [bpmn.io](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js).

At the moment, it offers:
- a special page used to create or modify BPMN workflows
- a parser that will render any valid BPMN XML that was put inside <bpmn/> tags

And that's about it. I plan on adding more features in the future, but don't hold your breath.
